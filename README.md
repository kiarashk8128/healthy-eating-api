## Overview
Healthy Menu is a comprehensive application designed to help users create weekly meal plans based on their nutritional needs. The application allows users to input their personal data or family members' data, and automatically generates a healthy, balanced menu tailored to their dietary requirements. The menus are generated using a combination of food group data, serving size recommendations, and dietary guidelines.

The application is built with a robust backend for handling data processing and a user-friendly frontend for easy interaction. It supports multiple users and provides personalized menus based on individual profiles, including age, gender, and specific dietary needs.

## Project Architecture
The Healthy Menu project follows a modular architecture, dividing the application into distinct layers that handle specific responsibilities. The main layers are:

1. **Backend (Django)**: Handles all business logic, data processing, and interaction with the database. It’s responsible for generating menus, managing user profiles, and enforcing dietary guidelines.

2. **Frontend (React.js)**: Provides an interactive user interface for users to manage their profiles, generate menus, and view their weekly plans. It communicates with the backend via API calls.

3. **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Stores all persistent data, including user profiles, food items, dietary guidelines, and generated menus.

4. **API Layer**: Facilitates communication between the frontend and backend. This layer handles authentication, data validation, and serves as the gateway to backend services.

5. **Deployment (Docker & Nginx)**: The project is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scaling. Nginx is used as a reverse proxy to handle incoming requests and serve the application.

## Technologies Used
The Healthy Menu project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Python & Django**: Core backend framework for handling data processing, business logic, and ORM for database interactions.
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building the user interface and managing user interactions.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system for storing and querying user data, food groups, and menus.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool used for packaging the application and its dependencies for easy deployment.
- **Nginx**: Web server and reverse proxy for handling HTTP requests and serving the frontend application.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client used in the frontend for making API requests.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for securing API endpoints and managing user authentication.

## Features
Healthy Menu provides a range of features designed to promote healthy eating habits:

1. **User and Family Member Profiles**: Users can create profiles for themselves and their family members, each with individual dietary needs.
   
2. **Automated Menu Generation**: Based on user profiles, the system generates a weekly meal plan that meets daily nutritional requirements.

3. **Customizable Food Groups**: The backend supports a comprehensive list of food items categorized into food groups, which can be adjusted or expanded.

4. **Dietary Guidelines Enforcement**: The system includes dietary guidelines such as consuming a variety of vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. These are enforced in the generated menus.

5. **Interactive Frontend**: Users can easily navigate the application, generate new menus, and view or adjust their profiles through a clean and responsive interface.

6. **Security and Authentication**: User data is protected through secure authentication mechanisms using JWT, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify their profiles.

7. **Scalability and Deployment**: The application is containerized with Docker, making it easy to deploy, scale, and manage in various environments.

## Models and Database

The backend of the Healthy Menu project uses Django's ORM to define the core models that represent the data structure of the application. Below are the primary models and their purposes:

- **CustomUser**:
  - Stores user-specific data, including authentication credentials and profile information.
  - Acts as the main user entity in the application.

- **FamilyMember**:
  - Represents additional family members associated with a user.
  - Stores relevant data like name, age, gender, height, weight, and dietary requirements.

- **FoodGroup**:
  - Defines categories of food items, such as Vegetables, Fruits, Grains, etc.
  - Contains fields like `fgid`, `fgcat_id`, `fgcat`, and `foodgroup`.

- **Food**:
  - Stores individual food items, including their group category, serving sizes, and nutritional information.
  - Linked to `FoodGroup` via a foreign key.

- **ServingPerDay**:
  - Specifies the recommended daily servings for different age groups and genders.
  - Linked to the corresponding food groups.

- **Menu**:
  - Represents a generated menu for a user or family member.
  - Stores the meals for each day of the week, including the food items and serving sizes.

### Database Initialization

The database is initialized with a set of predefined food groups, foods, and serving recommendations. These are loaded into the database during setup using Django’s migration and fixture system.

   **Apply Migrations**: Run migrations to create the necessary tables in the database.
   
         docker-compose exec backend python manage.py makemigrations
         docker-compose exec backend python manage.py migrate


## Logic and Algorithms

### Menu Generation Logic
   The logic for generating a healthy menu is based on a combination of user data, food serving requirements, and directional statements (guidelines). The process follows these steps:

   **User Data**: The user's age, gender, and dietary preferences are taken into account.
   
   **Serving Requirements**: The daily servings required for different food groups are determined based on the user's age and gender.
   
   **Directional Statements**: Guidelines such as "Make half your grains whole grains" or "Choose lower-fat milk products" are applied to ensure a balanced and healthy menu.
   
   **Food Selection**: Food items are randomly selected from the available options within each food group to fulfill the serving requirements.
   
   **Menu Composition**: The menu is composed for each day of the week, ensuring that all guidelines are met.
   
### Loading Food Data
   The food data, including food groups and serving recommendations, is loaded into the database from CSV files. These CSV files contain the initial dataset required for the application.

Steps to Load Food Data:

**Prepare the CSV Files**:

Ensure that the CSV files are formatted correctly and placed in the data directory.

**Run the Data Load Command**:

Use Django's custom management command to load the food data into the database.

      docker-compose exec backend python manage.py load_food_data
      
**Verify the Data**:

After loading the data, verify that the food items, food groups, and serving recommendations have been correctly populated in the database.

### Generating Menus
   The menu generation algorithm creates a weekly meal plan based on the user's dietary needs and preferences. The process includes:

**Determine Serving Requirements**: Based on the user's age, gender, and dietary restrictions, calculate the daily servings required for each food group.

**Apply Directional Statements**: Ensure that the menu adheres to nutritional guidelines, such as including a specific number of servings of whole grains or vegetables.

 **Random Food Selection**:Randomly select food items from the available options to meet the serving requirements.
 
**Generate Daily Menus**: Compose the menu for each day of the week, ensuring a variety of meals and compliance with nutritional guidelines.

**Final Adjustments**: After the initial menu is generated, apply any necessary adjustments, such as ensuring that vegetables are served more frequently than juice or that lean meats are included.

**Store the Menu**: Once the menu is generated, it is stored in the database associated with the user or family member.


By following these steps, the Healthy Menu project generates a balanced, nutritious weekly menu tailored to the specific needs of each user.
